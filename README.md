# Multivariate Data Analysis

This repository contains the final project from Wellesley's Multivariate Data Analysis course (CS 228) in Spring 2022. The final project is a supervised data analysis on a bivariate response dataset. The project utilizes regression, Bayesian, and tree-based methods along with comparative metrics to find the optimal model.

## Abstract
Male infertility is a common disease that accounts for 40-50% of total infertility cases. This study aims to find significant predictors and the best model for predicting male fertility. UCI Machine Learning collected semen samples and participant information relating to 9 socio-demographic, environmental, lifestyle, and health predictors from 100 volunteers. We compared regression, Bayesian, and 4 tree-based methods (CART, bagging, random forest, and boosting) and found the boosting model to have the best predictive power. Our findings agreed with existing literature that (older) age, exercise, and (the presence of) medical conditions/injuries are significant predictors of male infertility.
